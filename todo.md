As per Grok on 28 February 2025:

Given your situation, where you need to act quickly on new rental property listings from an agency that sends emails when new offers are available, automating the process can indeed maximize your chances of securing a viewing. You’ve outlined two potential approaches: periodically scanning the website for new listings or using the emailed notifications as a trigger. Both have merits, but I’ll help you evaluate which might be better and guide you through a step-by-step solution using Python (since you’re comfortable with it and it has robust libraries for this task). Your Raspberry Pi will also come in handy as a home server to run this automation continuously.
Evaluating the Options
Option A: Periodically Scanning the Website
Pros:
Doesn’t depend on email delivery, which can sometimes be delayed.
Can be set to check frequently (e.g., every few minutes), potentially catching new listings faster.
Cons:
Requires constant polling, which uses more resources and might be seen as aggressive web scraping, risking your IP being blocked.
You’d need a way to identify new listings (e.g., by timestamp or position on the page), which could be tricky without an RSS feed.
Option B: Using Email as a Trigger
Pros:
Only activates when a new email arrives, reducing unnecessary website checks and resource use.
Less likely to trigger anti-bot measures since it’s not constantly hitting the website.
Cons:
Relies on email delivery, which could be delayed, causing you to miss out on acting quickly.
If the agency doesn’t send an email for some reason, you’d miss the listing.
Since your goal is to maximize your chances of getting a viewing, speed is critical. Option A might catch listings faster but risks being blocked by the website if you poll too often. Option B is more efficient and safer but depends on timely emails. To balance these factors, I recommend starting with Option B (email trigger) as your primary method, since it’s less resource-intensive and aligns with the agency’s notification system. You can supplement it with periodic website checks (e.g., every few hours) if you’re worried about email delays, creating a hybrid approach.
For now, let’s focus on building a solution using Option B, as it’s the most straightforward and ethical starting point. We’ll use Python and your Raspberry Pi to implement it.
Solution Overview
Here’s the plan:
Monitor your Gmail inbox for new emails from the rental agency.
Extract the street name (e.g., "Herenstraat") from the email to identify the property.
Scrape the agency’s homepage to find the property’s listing link.
Automate filling out the contact form on the property’s page.
We’ll use:
imaplib to check Gmail for new emails.
BeautifulSoup to scrape the website.
Selenium to fill out the web form.
Your Raspberry Pi to run the script continuously.
Step-by-Step Guide
Step 1: Set Up Email Monitoring
You’ll monitor your Gmail inbox for unread emails from the rental agency using Python’s imaplib.
Prerequisites:
Enable IMAP in your Gmail settings (under "Settings > See all settings > Forwarding and POP/IMAP").
If you have 2-factor authentication (2FA), generate an App Password in your Google Account settings under "Security > App passwords" (select "Mail" and "Other" as the app, then name it something like "RentalBot").
Here’s a script to check for new emails:
python
import imaplib
import email
from email.header import decode_header

# Gmail IMAP settings
USERNAME = "your_email@gmail.com"  # Replace with your Gmail address
PASSWORD = "your_app_password"     # Replace with your App Password
IMAP_SERVER = "imap.gmail.com"

# Connect to the server
mail = imaplib.IMAP4_SSL(IMAP_SERVER)
mail.login(USERNAME, PASSWORD)
mail.select("inbox")

# Search for unread emails from the rental agency
status, messages = mail.search(None, '(UNSEEN FROM "rental_agency_email")')  # Replace with the agency’s email address
message_ids = messages[0].split()

for msg_id in message_ids:
    _, msg_data = mail.fetch(msg_id, "(RFC822)")
    raw_email = msg_data[0][1]
    email_message = email.message_from_bytes(raw_email)
    
    # Extract subject and body
    subject = decode_header(email_message["Subject"])[0][0]
    if isinstance(subject, bytes):
        subject = subject.decode()
    
    body = ""
    if email_message.is_multipart():
        for part in email_message.walk():
            if part.get_content_type() == "text/plain":
                body = part.get_payload(decode=True).decode()
    else:
        body = email_message.get_payload(decode=True).decode()
    
    # Check if it’s a property email (e.g., contains a street name like "Herenstraat")
    if "Herenstraat" in body:  # Adjust based on actual email content
        street_name = "Herenstraat"  # We’ll refine this in Step 2
        print(f"New property found: {street_name}")
        # Trigger next steps here (to be added later)

mail.logout()
Run it periodically: On your Raspberry Pi, use a cron job to run this script every 5 minutes:
bash
crontab -e
Add this line:
bash
*/5 * * * * /usr/bin/python3 /home/pi/rental_bot.py
(Adjust the path to match where you save your script.)
Step 2: Extract the Street Name
The email references the property by its street name (e.g., "Herenstraat"). You need to extract this to find the listing on the website.
For simplicity, let’s assume the email body contains a line like "New property on Herenstraat, Leiden." You can use a regular expression to extract the street name dynamically:
python
import re

# Add this after finding the email body
match = re.search(r"New property on (\w+), Leiden", body)
if match:
    street_name = match.group(1)
    print(f"Extracted street name: {street_name}")
else:
    print("Couldn’t extract street name. Check email format.")
    street_name = None
Note: Adjust the regex based on the actual email format. If it’s inconsistent, you might need more sophisticated parsing or multiple patterns.
Step 3: Scrape the Agency’s Homepage
The "Meer weten" button links to the homepage, where properties are listed by street name, with the newest (e.g., "Herenstraat") at the top. Use requests and BeautifulSoup to find the property link.
First, install the required library:
bash
pip3 install requests beautifulsoup4
Then add this to your script:
python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

AGENCY_URL = "https://www.rentalagency.com/homepage"  # Replace with the actual URL

if street_name:
    response = requests.get(AGENCY_URL)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, "html.parser")
    
    # Find the property link by street name
    property_link = None
    for link in soup.find_all("a", href=True):
        if street_name in link.text:
            property_link = link["href"]
            break
    
    if property_link:
        # Ensure it’s a full URL
        if not property_link.startswith("http"):
            full_url = f"https://www.rentalagency.com{property_link}"
        else:
            full_url = property_link
        print(f"Property URL: {full_url}")
    else:
        print("Property not found on homepage.")
Note: If the homepage uses JavaScript to load listings, BeautifulSoup won’t work. You’d need Selenium to render the page (see Step 4). Test this first with the actual website.
Step 4: Automate Form Filling with Selenium
Once you have the property URL, use Selenium to navigate to the page and fill out the contact form.
Install Selenium:
bash
pip3 install selenium
Install a WebDriver: For Firefox, download geckodriver:
bash
wget https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases/download/v0.33.0/geckodriver-v0.33.0-linux64.tar.gz
tar -xvzf geckodriver-v0.33.0-linux64.tar.gz
sudo mv geckodriver /usr/local/bin/
Also install Firefox on your Raspberry Pi:
bash
sudo apt install firefox-esr
Add this to your script:
python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC

if property_link:
    # Set up Selenium with Firefox
    driver = webdriver.Firefox()
    driver.get(full_url)
    
    # Wait for the form to load (adjust timeout as needed)
    wait = WebDriverWait(driver, 10)
    form = wait.until(EC.presence_of_element_located((By.ID, "contact-form")))  # Replace with actual form ID
    
    # Fill out the form (inspect the webpage to find field names/IDs)
    name_field = driver.find_element(By.NAME, "name")  # Adjust based on actual field name
    name_field.send_keys("Your Name")
    
    email_field = driver.find_element(By.NAME, "email")
    email_field.send_keys("your_email@gmail.com")
    
    # Add other fields as needed (e.g., phone, message)
    
    # Submit the form
    submit_button = driver.find_element(By.NAME, "submit")  # Adjust based on actual button
    submit_button.click()
    
    print("Form submitted successfully!")
    driver.quit()
Customization: Inspect the property page’s form (right-click > "Inspect" in Firefox) to find the correct IDs or names for fields and the submit button.

            form = wait.until(EC.presence_of_element_located((By.ID, "contact-form")))  # Adjust ID
            driver.find_element(By.NAME, "name").send_keys("Your Name")  # Adjust field name
            driver.find_element(By.NAME, "email").send_keys("your_email@gmail.com")
            driver.find_element(By.NAME, "submit").click()  # Adjust button name
            print("Form submitted!")
            driver.quit()

mail.logout()
Handling Challenges
Email Format Changes: If the email structure varies, test and adjust the regex or parsing logic.
Website Updates: The homepage or form might change. Regularly check and update your script’s selectors.
Anti-Bot Measures: If the website has CAPTCHAs, automation might fail. You could modify the script to alert you (e.g., via email or text) to fill it out manually.
Final Recommendation
Best Option: Start with Option B (email trigger) for its efficiency and lower risk of being blocked. Add periodic checks later if needed.
Setup: Run this script on your Raspberry Pi with a cron job every 5 minutes.
Ethics: Check the agency’s website terms of service to ensure compliance. Avoid overly aggressive actions.
This setup should help you respond to new listings quickly, boosting your chances of getting a viewing. Let me know if you need tweaks or run into issues!
